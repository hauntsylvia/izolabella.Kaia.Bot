# 💮 Kaia.Bot

📖 Historical books to collect, and a unique take on advanced economy built around counting.

Kaia offers a unique economy, featuring books to collect for passive income and random, rare chances when counting to earn petals; the economy's currency. 
All petals earned can be used to buy more books, or otherwise buy items in the store to interact with.

# 👩‍💻 Development
Kaia is still growing! New commands, books, and items are added weekly. Quality of life updates are done almost daily.

Kaia offers the possibility to disable unwanted commands, or otherwise restrict certain commands to certain roles, permissions, or users.
